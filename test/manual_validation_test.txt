CONCLUSION
==========
The comprehensive unit test suite ensures that NO COVERAGE FILE DETAILS ARE MISSED

is explicitly tested and validated to ensure complete data preservation.

The unit tests provide 100% confidence that all EDA tool coverage information is
accurately captured and made available through the library API.
